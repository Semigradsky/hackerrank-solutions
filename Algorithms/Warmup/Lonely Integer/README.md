# [Lonely Integer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lonely-integer)

## Problem Statement

There are N integers in an array A. All but one integer occur in pairs. Your task is to find out the number that occurs only once.

## Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating number of integers. 
The next line contains N space separated integers that form the array A.

## Constraints

1 <= N < 100

N % 2 = 1 ( N is an odd number )

0 <= A[i] <= 100, ∀ i ∈ [1, N]

## Output Format

Output S, the number that occurs only once.

## Sample Input: 1
```
1
1
```

## Sample Output: 1
```
1
```

## Sample Input: 2
```
3
1 1 2
```

## Sample Output: 2
```
2
```

## Sample Input: 3
```
5
0 0 1 2 1
```

## Sample Output: 3
```
2
```

## Explanation

In the first input, we see only 1 element and that element is the answer (1).

In the second input, we see 3 elements, 1 is repeated twice. The element that occurs only once is 2.

In the third input, we see 5 elements, 1 and 0 are repeated twice. And the element that occurs only once is 2.

## Solution

### JavaScript
```javascript
function processData(input) {
  var data = input.split('\n').slice(1)[0].split(' ');

  data = data.filter(function(x) {
    return data.indexOf(x) === data.lastIndexOf(x);
  });

  process.stdout.write(data[0]);
} 
```
